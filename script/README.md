# Execution Scripts for Reproducibility 

The R script collected in this folder allows the entire reproduction of all the numbers, and figures shown in "_Building Artificially Intelligent Geostatistical Systems Using Bayesian Predictive Stacking_". Here a brief reminder of which script is needed to reproduce the contents of a specific Section is presented to ease the reproducibility. Reminding the Workflow on the main `README.md` of this repository, for an exhaustive, and detailed, approach to reproduce the results.
